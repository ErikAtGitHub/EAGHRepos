This repository includes two projects constructed using a training tutorial by The Software Guild: a mock restaurant site and a dice-based gambling game called Lucky Sevens. In Lucky Sevens, you place a bet and click play. The game continually rolls a pair of dice. If the roll equals seven, you win 4$. If they equal anything else, you lose 1$. It's a losing game so you eventually lose all your money and a table appears at the end to show some statistics.
